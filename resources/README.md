# Relevant variables

- Temperature (Temp Out/In)
  - It's important to note that the internal temperature almost never
    fails, contrary to the outside temperature.
  - High and low temperature are also important to have in order for a
    proper analysis for the experts.
- External relative humidity (Out Hum)
- Wind speed
- Wind direction (Wind Dir)*
  - Although its a primary variable (measurable directly from a sensor), it
    won't be predicted by the model as it's a cardinal value
- Atmospheric pressure (Bar)
- Rain
  - It's important to sum all the rain that has fallen in time when
    resampling as it's important to know it for the experts.
- Solar radiation (Solar Rad)
- Soil humidity (Soil Temp)
- Leaf Wetness (Leaf Wet)
